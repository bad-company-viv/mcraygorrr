      The actions people take can affect the environment either positively or negatively. This is the concept behind the carbon footprint, which is a method to measure the environmental effect of our lifestyle. A carbon footprint, measured in tons (usually), indicates the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that are produced as a result of our daily activities.
      
      McRAYGOR commits to be 100% carbon neutral for its supply chain and products by 2029. Already carbon neutral today for our production worldwide, the company plans to bring its entire carbon footprint to net zero 20 years sooner than IPCC targets.
      
      Low carbon product design: We will continue to increase the use of low carbon and recycled materials in our machines & products, innovate in product recycling, and design products to be as energy efficient as possible.
